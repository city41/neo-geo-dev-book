Whenever your Neo Geo game is not working the way you want it to, figuring out what is wrong can be challenging. There is no simple way to log out information to aid in debugging. Later on we will use the gdb debugger for a proper interactive debugger experience. But for now, we are going to build a development console that will allow us to print out variable values and such to help us figure out why things aren't working correctly. This is both a useful tool to have and a good first real dip into Neo Geo programming, so let's get started!

## What we are building
