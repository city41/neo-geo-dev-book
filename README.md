# Modern Neo Geo Development Book

This is an e-book on developing for SNK's Neo Geo. The focus is on using modern open source tooling and best practices to create a complete game.

The book uses [ngdevkit](https://github.com/dciabrin/ngdevkit) as the core dev environment, [sromcrom](https://github.com/city41/sromcrom) to build and manage graphic assets, Make for project management and most (all?) code will be in C.

## Status

I just started this very recently, so there's quite a long ways to go.

## Goals

* Walk through building an entire game from start to finish. The game is the classic snake game often found on old cell phones.
* Understand the Neo Geo's hardware and how it impacts game creation
* Be able to program the Z80 enough to pull off simple sound effects and music
* stretch goal: additional chapters that give some insight into some more advanced topics such as fixed point numbers, scaling, palette swapping, performance, debugging with gdb etc.
