# Installing the Tools

In this chapter we will install the tools needed for development. The primary goal is to make sure they get installed correctly and that you are able to compile and run code. Don't worry too much about the details, later chapters will dig in much more.

## Install ngdevkit

## Install ngdevkit-examples

## Install NeoSprite

## Neospriteviewer

The Neospriteviewer website at https://city41.github.io/neospriteviewer is a convenient way to see the graphic tiles inside of C and S ROMs. We will use this tool often throughout the book to see where certain tiles are in S ROMs that we borrow from other games (more on that in the next chapter) as well as confirming our C ROMs are getting built properly.
