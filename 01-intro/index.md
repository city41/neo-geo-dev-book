## Quick history on the Neo Geo

## Why write this book

Despite the Neo Geo being such a neat system, its homebrew scene is quite sparse compared to most other consoles. Over the decades a lot of research, documentation and tools have been created. But discovering all of this and bringing it all together has been challenging. Most tools are written for Windows and are closed source. I want to see open source, cross platform tools. This can enable better tools to be created, and for more people to participate and ultimately create more homebrew.

I also wanted a cohesive guide that takes the reader from no knowledge of Neo Geo programming to being able to create any game they want. The Neo Geo Dev wiki is an awesome resource, but it's a bit difficult to know where to start and how to piece all of the information together. This book is an attempt to remedy that. After reading this book and building the apps and games in it, you should be able to refer to Neo Geo Dev wiki and use it as the awesome reference resource it is.

## Who is this book for

To get the most out of this book I think you need some kind of programming experience. This book primarily uses C and Make, but experience in them is not necessary. If you are comfortable using the command line, and are capable in at least one programming language, you should be just fine. If you are brand new to programming, starting with the Neo Geo is not recommended. You will probably be more successful learning general programming and getting some experience that way before taking on something as specific and niche as this system.
