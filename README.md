# Modern Neo Geo Development Book

This is an e-book on developing for SNK's Neo Geo. The focus is on using modern open source tooling and best practices to create a complete game.

The book uses [ngdevkit](https://github.com/dciabrin/ngdevkit) as the core dev environment, [sromcrom](https://github.com/city41/sromcrom) to build and manage graphic assets, Make for project management and most (all?) code will be in C.

## Status

I just started this very recently, so there's quite a long ways to go. You can see the current overall status per chapter here: https://neogeobook.mattgreer.dev/book

### Book is not dead!

I know I haven't worked on this in ages, real life got in the way. But I am determined to fully finish this book, it's important to me. Thanks for your patience.

## Goals

- Walk through building an entire simple breakout game from start to finish.
- Understand the Neo Geo's hardware and how it impacts game creation
- Be able to program the Z80 enough to pull off simple sound effects and music
- Advanced topics like using gdb, fixed point math, etc
