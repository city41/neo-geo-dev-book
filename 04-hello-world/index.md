# Hello World

Finally in chapter four we begin actually coding. We are going to start small, with our only goal being to show "HELLO NEO GEO" on the screen.

If you remember from chapter 2, a Neo Geo game has many different types of ROMs. All of these ROMs must be present in order for a game to work, which imposes a significant burden on geting started. To make matters worse, the Neo Geo has no built in way to display text! To overcome these obstacles and get up and running more quickly, we won't be starting from scratch. Instead we will use an existing game as our basis, and swap in our own P ROM.
